# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Beyond this repo

These files are what the repo knows. What people asserted about this project, and how other projects handled the same problem, live in Mantly — see `docs/agents/mantly.md` for the binding and when to read it. If that file isn't here, this repo isn't bound to Mantly, which is a normal state.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 2026-03-14-event-sourced-orders.md
│   └── 2026-04-02-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── apps/
    └── packages/
```

This repo is a Turborepo monorepo (`apps/*`, `packages/*`), but the domain layout stays single-context for now: the apps are still default scaffolding with no separated business domains yet. Revisit as `apps/web`, a future `apps/api`, etc. grow their own business logic — switch to a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` + per-app `CONTEXT.md` layout at that point (see the multi-context example in the seed template at `~/.claude/skills/setup-team-skills/domain.md`).

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:
